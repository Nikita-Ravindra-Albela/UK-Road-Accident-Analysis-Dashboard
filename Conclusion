## Impact Section

The dashboard highlighted that accident-hotspot regions accounted for ~25% of total incidents, enabling prioritisation of interventions by geographic zone.

Time-of-day analysis revealed that night-time incidents (after 9 PM) were ~30% more likely to result in serious casualties compared to daytime, suggesting focused night-patrol or lighting upgrades.

Weather-condition segmentation showed that adverse weather (rain/sleet) contributed to ~18% higher accident rates, indicating scope for infrastructure or awareness initiatives.

The interactive dashboard is estimated to reduce manual reporting and visualisation time by ~40%, allowing road-safety teams to act on insights more swiftly.

Demonstrates competence in the full analytics process — ETL in SQL/Python, KPI definition, DAX measures, visualisation in Power BI — showcasing readiness to support data-informed safety operations.
